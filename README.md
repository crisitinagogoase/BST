The application is a simulaiton of a game, (that implements Binary Search Trees and Classes) and  that depending on which action you choose from the menu, 1,2,3,4,5, it does the following:

1. Display the wizards sorted in ascending order, based on their score 

2. Display the total score of a house.

3. Display each member of a Hogwarts house grouped by category. (depending on the score, each member is associated with a Hogwarts house)
	- if the score is between 0 and 5000, the house is Hufflepuff
	- if the score is between 5000 and 20000, the house is Gryffindor
	- if the score is between 20000 and 50000, the house is Ravenclaw
	- if the score is >50,000, the house is Slytherin.)

4. See if we can play Quidditch. (the game can take place only if the set of wizards is whole. It is said that the set is whole if all the Tree nodes have zero or two wires.)

5. See if the sequence exists. ( Given a sequence of scores in ascending order that represent the players, check if this sequence exists and in the affirmative, display the names of the players always in ascending order. )
